        <h2>HOW I FAST KNEW I WAS A DAWG...</h2>

        <p>
          One day when i was 2 years old,I sat down on a rocking chair and I just 
          imagined to myself,'who has to tell me that im the dawg if not me?'.</br>
          I fuckin realized that i was the dawg that day henceforth.</br>
        </p>

          <p>
            Once I realized I was becoming more of a dawg as days went by</br>
            I eventually had to find a name for me...and the first name that crossed my mind</br>
            was FrankGotThatDawg_</br>
            All my homies call me that.Oh,and bitches too.

           Whether I‚Äôm coding, chilling, or working out, there's always a playlist playing in the background.</br>
            Music helps me focus, reflect, and express who I am.

        <h3>üíª Coding ‚Äì Turning Ideas Into Reality</h3>

        <p>
          Coding is where everything comes together for me. It's logical yet creative.</br>
           I love building things from scratch, solving problems, and learning new tech skills.</br>
            Whether it‚Äôs front-end design or back-end logic, writing code gives me the tools to shape the digital world.</br>
            I also want to venture in AI because this is the future of the world.
